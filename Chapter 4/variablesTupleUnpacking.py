#The multiple assignment trick (technically called tuple unpacking) is 
#a shortcut that lets you assign multiple variables with the values in 
#a list in one line of code. 
# 
# It looks like this:

cat = ['fat','gray','loud']
size, color, disposition = cat   

print(cat)
print(size)
print(color)
print(disposition)
